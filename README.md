# Kitura AngularJS Sample

![Timestamp Screenshot](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-AngularJS-Sample/raw/master/docs/timestamps.png)

## Summary

This project demonstrates a very simple web application based on Kitura that integrates with an AngularJS client application. It communicates with a Kitura backend and displays the data in a browser-based user interface.

This application example allows users to set and get previous timestamps that have been stored in the past. The service routes are defined in `main.swift` on the server and can be consumed by any clientâ€”iOS or Android applications, web client, etc. In the case of this sample, the timestamp services are consumed via REST calls made from an AngularJS client service.
